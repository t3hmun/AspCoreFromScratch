# Why

After reading many of the design discussions for various parts of .Net Core, I've noticed that Microsoft's priority is to make things easy for most people.
Most people are novice professionals trying to kick a minimal viable solution out the door.
As a result everything is wrapped in huge amounts of magic, magic that makes everything simple and easy... until something goes wrong.

My purpose here is to look inside the magical incantations that the tutorials and Pluralsight videos teach us and understand why.
When you know why you have insight when a strange error unexpectedly brings everything to a halt.
When you inevitably encounter a strange requirement unique to your situation, you want to have the knowledge to build your own path.

But by far the biggest reason is **curiosity**.
