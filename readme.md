# ASP.NET Core 2 from Scratch

Starting with a blank csproj, every single line of every single file explained.

These days we rely on far too much 'magic' to make our application work.
Its quick and easy but when something does go wrong we are clueless.

> [2019-05-28] Sidenote: I'm desparately hoping that Core is somewhat stable but I'm guessing everything will change when .NET 5 happens in [November 2020](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/roadmap.md).
